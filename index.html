        <p>
            Hey Mum, your strength, love, and constant support have always been my guiding light. 
            You've always put our family first, showing me the importance of kindness, hard work, 
            and perseverance. Your wisdom and encouragement have made me who I am today. 
            Thanks for being my rock, my inspiration, and my biggest cheerleader. I'm so grateful 
            to have you in my life. <span class="hearts">🌟🌟</span>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I just wanted to take a moment to remind you of how much I love you. You fill my world with 
            warmth and happiness, and I hope this small token makes your day just a little brighter.
            There's no one quite like you in this world, and I'm the luckiest person to have a mom 
            as wonderful as you. 💖
        </p>
        
        <p>
            You make every day a little sweeter, and I can't thank you enough for all that you do. From 
            the way you care for everyone around you, to your gentle heart, everything about you is simply 
            beautiful. You're my hero, my best friend, and my forever guide. 💐

            Dear Mom, <br> 
            I can’t even begin to express how thankful I am for everything you’ve done for me. From the very start, you’ve given me the greatest gift of all – the gift of life. You’ve shaped me into the person I am today with your love, care, and unwavering support. No words are enough to show you how much I appreciate you.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think about all the times you stood by me, even when no one else did. You’ve been there through every step, offering advice, wiping away tears, and sharing in my joys. There have been ups and downs, but through it all, you’ve remained my rock. The love you’ve given me is more than I could have ever asked for, and I’m so blessed to be your daughter.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you, Mom, for being my biggest cheerleader, for believing in me when I doubted myself, and for teaching me what it means to be strong and resilient. You’ve set the most amazing example of courage and selflessness. From juggling work, family, and everything in between, you’ve shown me what it means to be truly dedicated.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every memory we’ve made together is a treasure that I hold close to my heart. You’ve given up so much for me, made countless sacrifices, and yet you never expected anything in return. You’ve always put our family first, and I just want you to know how deeply I admire and respect you for that.
        </p>
        <p>
            You are not only my mom but also my best friend. You’re the person I turn to when I need advice, comfort, or just someone to talk to. I can always count on you to be there, and that means more to me than you’ll ever know. Thank you for your love, your wisdom, and your endless support.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope to make you proud in everything I do because I carry your love and lessons with me every single day. You’re my hero, my role model, and the most beautiful person inside and out. I love you more than words can say, and I’ll forever be grateful for everything you’ve done for me. 
        </p>
        <p class="highlight">Thank you, Mom, from the bottom of my heart. I love you.</p>
